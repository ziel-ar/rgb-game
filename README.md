# rgb-game
The game was created as part of the Colt Steele's course on Udemy (The Web Developer Bootcamp). This project taught me how to manipulate DOM and refactor my code into smaller functions. Also gave me a lot of joy and satisfaction from creating something that does not look horrible and can be really fun!
